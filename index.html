    <h1>Sustainable Water Management and Safe Sanitation</h1>
    <p>Water is essential for life, yet billions of people around the world lack access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation. This is not only a health issue, but also a barrier to poverty reduction, food security, peace, human rights, and education. By managing our water sustainably, we can also improve food and energy production, create jobs, and combat climate change. Let's work together to ensure that everyone has access to clean water and sanitation by 2030.</p>
